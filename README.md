# MyReads Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. It is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:
* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

You can search the books and categorize them according to your need. You can move your books from one shelf to the other.

## How to run the app
Clone the project using the following command: 
<code> git clone https://github.com/salonikodeo/fend-project-myreads</code>
Run command : <code>npm install</code>
Run command: <code>npm start</code>
The app will automatically open in your browser and you can use it.
